<h1> Tkinter Classification GUI </h1>
Simple template for a classification gui. Brings up images one by one in directory, and allows user to classify each image. Each classified image will be saved into the appropriate directory, allowing dataset creation. User can input any number of classes, and will save classified images accordingly.

Removed CLI and added gui interface for starting the program. Useful for users who can't or don't want to use a CLI.
Example usage

<code>
  python3 tkinter_classification.py
</code>
